## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

What's fascinating about my experience is that I took a break from this project for several months to focus on enhancing my HTML and CSS skills. I enrolled in a comprehensive course at https://learnhtmlcss.online/, and when I returned to the project, I managed to overcome the remaining challenges that had previously stumped me in just about two hours. It truly made a world of difference.

```html
<h1>ALL OF IT</h1>
```

```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  seriusly, all of it.
}
```
